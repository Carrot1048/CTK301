      <h2>Excerpt</h2>
      <p>“Hoooooowl!” The sound was getting closer as I ran through the forest. I had seen these woods before and they were very pretty, especially at night, but I wasn’t sightseeing this time. As I ran, my only thought was, ‘I have to get away; I have to get away.’ I ended up so lost in my thoughts that by the time I saw the slope, it was too late. I tumbled down, hitting tree after tree, rock after rock. It felt like being beaten with a bat. After what seemed like an hour, but was probably only a couple of minutes, I came to a halt. My body hurt like the dickens and I just laid there, but then I remembered why I was running. I got up slowly and painfully, about to start running again, but it was too late. It was here. <br>I looked into the deep yellow eyes of what would be my killer. I saw its long claws digging into the wet earth, its fangs dripping with the flesh of its last kill, and I had never felt so afraid. At the same time though, I felt this pride that I was actually looking at it, the biggest wolf known-well unknown-to humankind. Before I could revel in that accomplishment for long, it lunged and…
      <br>I woke up with a start; boy did I hate that dream. I’ve been having it for the past few weeks and every time it happened, I would wake up in a cold sweat. I looked at my clock and saw that it was 4:30. No sense in going back to sleep. I probably couldn’t anyway so I got up to go take a shower. The warm water pounding my face and body helped calm my nerves and then since it was still early, school not starting for another 2 hours, I decided to go make my family breakfast.
