        <a href="https://secretsofothniel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">“Before</a> you go getting your <a href="https://tallstories20.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">hopes up</a>, you cannot actually turn into a<a href="https://oleftage.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"> wolf</a>; yet. That will take a while before you can become strong enough to do that and the only ones that can do that are Alpha wolves or the leaders of the pack. In order for somebody to turn into a werewolf, they have to be bitten by an Alpha werewolf and so I am guessing that the one that bit you is an Omega. Those are the “lone horsemen” you could say. You get stronger and faster when you stay in your human form, but those increase even more when you fully turn into a werewolf. You will still look like yourself, just with fangs, claws, a different eye color, and a little bit more hair. It is nothing like how they look in movies. Oh, it will take a bit before you can fully control it, but just don’t get angry and you will be fine. The only thing that the movies got right was that during a full moon, if you don’t know how to control it, you will transform and go primal,” Lex finished.
