        <a href="https://secretsofothniel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">My dream</a> didn’t give the wolf any justice at all. Those yellow eyes were richer than gold. It’s black fur was like obsidian, it’s fangs were like little daggers, and it had to be at least 4’ tall weighing 200 pounds. For that brief second all was fine then I remembered that this wasn’t a dream anymore. “AAAAAAHHHH!” I bolted. I’d like to think that I was running as fast as the wind, but that’s impossible. As I ran I could hear the wolf behind me. You know scenes that have you on the edge of your seat; well this was nothing like that. Shuddering so violently, I was surprised I didn’t have a muscle spasm. When running in the woods there are always risks that you have to take and obstacles you’ll have to overcome. In my case, I didn’t overcome that tree that came out of nowhere. THUD! My head felt like deadweight, and in a little bit, I’m pretty sure it would be. I sat up and looked around. That wolf was not to be seen. I touched my forehead, feeling the blood on it. At least I don’t have a concussion I thought. Only then did I notice that it wasn’t raining anymore and the woods were as silent as the stealthiest ninja. Not wanting to stay in the woods all night I began to walk in what I thought was the direction of the road. As I was walking I pulled out my phone so that I could use the gps. God must have smiled upon me because it worked. I never felt so ecstatic in my entire life. That ecstasy quickly ended when, from the light of my phone, I was able to see fang marks on my arm. I didn’t even feel it I thought, right before I passed out.

        <a href="https://tallstories20.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">I awoke</a> to the sound of rustling and for a brief second, I forgot where I was. Looking around, I noticed that everything looked the same so I couldn’t have been out for that long. Looking at my phone, I saw that only 10 minutes passed by. <span class="italic">I really hope Lex is alright.</span> Luckily the bite on my arm wasn’t bleeding and the cut on my forehead wasn’t so big. I just hope that I could get home before my mom did so she wouldn’t see me like this and panic. She would most definitely panic. Surprisingly, my gps was still working and since we didn’t live to far away from the school, it wasn’t hard for me to get back to the road that led back to my house. I started walking, but after all that I had just gone through I don’t know if you could call it that. I was moving slower than a turtle. <span class="italic">I really wish Lex was here.</span> Lex would know how to help me move faster. My body slowly became looser and I was able to pick up speed, but it was already 7 o’clock and my mom was supposed to get off in about an hour. At this pace, that is probably how long it would take me to get home. Not to mention that I didn’t know where Lex was. I had to fight the urge to look for him because we made a plan that if we were separated, we would both just head straight home. I hoped that he would be there before mom arrived as well and hoped that he didn’t look worse than me. Noticing the incline that I fell down, I decided to just walk along the bottom of it as to not draw attention to myself. I had never really looked at the woods before, but when you’re not getting chased by an angry giant wolf then you can actually see how beautiful they are. The trees are as tall as the tallest skyscrapers, not that I have actually seen a skyscraper and there are way more colors than brown and green. The trees have dark blue hues along some of the branches and the leaves come in more colors than I imagined. There are green, red, purple; actually, I have seen all of those colors before. You get the point, the woods are pretty.
